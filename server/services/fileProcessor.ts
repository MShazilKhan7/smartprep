Human Cell Structure and Function

The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Human cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane, as well as specialized structures called organelles.

Cell Membrane: The cell membrane is a semi-permeable barrier that surrounds the cell, controlling what enters and exits. It's made primarily of phospholipids arranged in a bilayer.

Nucleus: The nucleus contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities such as growth, metabolism, protein synthesis, and reproduction.

Cytoplasm: The cytoplasm is the gel-like substance between the cell membrane and nucleus. It contains water, salts, and various organic molecules.

Mitochondria: Often called the "powerhouses" of the cell, mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is used as a source of chemical energy.

Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): This network of membranes is involved in the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins and lipids. Rough ER has ribosomes attached to its surface, while smooth ER does not.

Golgi Apparatus: This organelle modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for storage in the cell or release outside the cell.

Lysosomes: These are membrane-bound vesicles containing digestive enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris.

Ribosomes: These small structures are the sites of protein synthesis. They can be found free in the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Cytoskeleton: This network of protein filaments provides structural support, assists in cell movement, and helps transport materials within the cell.

Cell Division: Cells reproduce through a process called mitosis, which results in two identical daughter cells. Before a cell divides, it duplicates its DNA during a phase called interphase.
